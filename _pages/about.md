Hello,
======

I am a ML practitioner interested in its applications in natural language processing, computer vision, speech processing, and information retrieval. I am particularly interested in solving real-world problems by building user-driven ML solutions that are grounded in research.

Currently, I am working on vision-language and self-supervised models for chest x-rays at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/index.html). Prior to this, I helped [LabTwin GmbH](https://www.labtwin.com/) build a voice assistant for the life sciences domain. Additionaly, I have also worked with Prof. Manfred Stede at the [Applied CL Discourse Research Lab](http://angcl.ling.uni-potsdam.de/) on argumentation mining and climate change discourse.

My other research interests include multimodal representation learning and knowledge graphs.

I am also a digital archivist who is doing their part to combat [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot).
